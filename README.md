Foodie's Corner is a web application which is built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and API. It shows the recipe details as well as the nutritional content of the recipe entered by the user. If the user does not enter any recipe name before search, an **Alert Window** pops up which tells the user to enter a recipe first.

Each of the recipes returned by the search result is presented in form of cards. There is a button **Get the recipe** in each of the cards, on click of which takes the user to the page containing full description to prepare and serve the recipe. **Calories, Diet label, Health labels and Estimated time** to prepare the recipe are also displayed in each of the cards.
